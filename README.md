## French vocabulary training

To initialise vocabulary, export saved words from Google Translate as .xlsx and put in directory 'data' as 'new.xlsx'. Then run:

```
python excel\update.py
```

When you want to update vocabulary, repeat the process (export as new.xlsx and run the same command).

To start, use:

```
python index.py
```

When in struggle, write '?' to see the translation.

To quit the program, write 'quit'. If you quit with Control + c or via closing the command line, the progress won't be saved.
